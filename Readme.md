# A complete framework for writing SAS Enterprise Guide Tasks

This library was originally developed in 2013 with SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 as a part of my final paper for a postgraduate program in statistics at University of Warsaw. Now I decided to release it to public.

It's basically a complete framework for writing custom tasks that can be used in EG flows. There isn't much documentation but you can have a look at a sample [task for PROC Lifereg](https://github.com/ms32035/MarcinSzymanski.Lifereg)
